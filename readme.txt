Throughout this assignment, we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, 
while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another?
    NPM allows you to install & use other people's code.
    Node modules are directories of set tools for build.

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?
    To share your code publicly in a user or Org namespace, you can publish public user-scoped or 
    Org-scoped packages to the npm registry.
    refer to "https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages"
